# R_CrashCourse

This script is intended to present you with a quick and dirty introduction to computer programming and specifically programming in R. A lot of basic R functions and information are presented, but certainly it's nowhere near comprehensive. As with most things, you'll find that if you try things out and mess around with your own examples, you'll learn and retain more of the information. The single best thing you can do to pick up any programming language really, including R, is to get your hands dirty and try things, even if you don't know if they will work. The chances that you'll break something are quite slim, and there's every chance that you'll discover something new for yourself.

If you've done some programming before, some of the concepts may be review; skip what you'd like, but I'd encourage you to at least skim most of the material. In several places I try to explain things that are peculiar quirks of R that can trip up even relatively experienced programmers not used to working in R.

There are a number of sections where I indicated 'Digressions' from the topic at hand. My intention in these sections is primarily to explain smaller, but still useful features or quirks of programming in R. Rather than providing bookmarks for sections to skip reading, my hope was to retain the flow of developing ideas and concepts by noting branching topics treated only briefly in this tutorial. Use them as you see fit.
